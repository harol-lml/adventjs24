anta Claus 🎅 is decorating a magical Christmas tree 🪄, which this year has a special structure in the form of a binary tree. Each node of the tree represents a gift, and Santa wants to know the height of the tree to place the magical star at the top.

Your task is to write a function that calculates the height of a binary tree. The height of a binary tree is defined as the maximum number of levels from the root to a leaf. An empty tree has a height of 0.
