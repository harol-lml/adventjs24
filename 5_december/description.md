**Santa Claus's elves üßùüßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è** have found a bunch of mismatched magic boots in the workshop. Each boot is described by two values:

* `type` indicates if it's a left boot (I) or a right boot (R).
* `size` indicates the size of the boot.

Your task is to help the elves pair all the boots of the same size having a left and a right one. To do this, you should return a list of the available boots after pairing them.

**Note:** You can have more than one pair of boots of the same size!
